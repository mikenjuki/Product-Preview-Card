## Overview

- The goal was to create a component of a fictional product card. The layout and design are guided by the style guide.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It was a good exercise to freshen up my vanilla CSS skills. Especially how to format and adjust text to fit the design as best as possible.

### Continued development

I want to try more challenges using a framework like Tailwind to be able to iterate on designs faster and leverage a design system developed by the best in the business.

I used this as a stepping stone for an upcoming products page in a future app.

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2WL6KkqhLQ) - This helped me for get a feel for the structure and some underused CSS syntax. I really liked this the thought process and I'll be sure to incorporate it in my work going forward.
